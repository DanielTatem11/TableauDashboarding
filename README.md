This dashboard was created using all For Sale Listings of homes and town homes under $500,000 in Orlando on Feb. 20, 2023. This data was used to help a first time homebuyer understand where in Orlando they could get the best value for their money, as well as a general idea of the pricing distribution.

*The data was pulled from Zillow's website using the Zillow Data Exporter extension.
